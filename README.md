# Calculate Wasserstein distance between two mineral age distributions. 

This python script calculates the 2nd Wasserstein distance, $W_2$, between the Byskealven and Vefsna age distributions from [Morton et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2008.07.001). It makes use of the [`POT` package](https://pythonot.github.io/).
The data required to run the script is provided in the two `.csv` files. The script can be run from command line using `python W2.py` and should return: `W2 = 490.0071914467088`
